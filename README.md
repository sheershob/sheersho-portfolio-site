# Sheersho's Portfolio Site
I've developed a portfolio website showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used Leetcode's graphql APIs to display
the total number of questions I’ve solved in each difficulty out of the total questions of Leetcode. Leetcode blocked direct API fetch requests so I used a CORS demo server to relay my API request.

Similarly, I have fetched chess.com’s user APIs to
display my current ratings in rapid, blitz, bullet, and daily time formats.
